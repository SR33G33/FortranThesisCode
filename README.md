Replaced MAIN3 with MAIN5 , the only differences are:
1. There are comments added
2. The Read BETA has been put back in (you will need to uncomment it in order to execute)
3. I experimented with using a dynamic format for READ BETA and for WRITE ALFA2 at the end. It will be interesting to see if it works
